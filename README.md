This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Note: If a problem with Tailwind CSS is encountered please install PostCSS

See link below: https://flaviocopes.com/fix-postcss-webpack-ruleset-oneof/ 

Install npm by downloading the latest stab√±le version: 

https://nodejs.org/en/download

Run command: 

```bash
npm install  postcss # install the postcss dependencies that allow the registration 
# When running this command version 8.4.35 works with next-auth 
# Version 10.2.3 does not work properly

```

Run command to install next-auth

```bash
npm install  next-auth # install the postcss dependencies that allow the registration
# Next-Auth version 10.5.0 funciona correctamente

```

Run command to start the login/registration server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Registration Page

Writes in MongoDB the information regarding the app users

All the data must be included, otherwise an error will appear

In case the mail already exists an error will appear

Once the user has been created successfully we will be redirected to the userLogin page

Our MongoDB User Collection will contain the information from the registration page with the defined documents/field_id
